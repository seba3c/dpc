# D3 Parallel Dynamic Coordinates Visualization

This is a Data Visualization using Parallel Coordinates and D3 Javascript library. The code is based on the following examples:

* [Parallel Coordinates - Example 1](https://bl.ocks.org/jasondavies/1341281)
* [Parallel Coordinates - Example 2](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1341021)

In addition, this implementation add the possibility to upload a CSV Dataset and visualize the data.
Each CSV column will be represented by an axis in the visualization. The CSV header will be use to name each coordinate in the visualization. The following is an example of a supported dataset:

* [Example CSV Dataset](res/cars.csv)

## Run the Visualization

Download the source code and open "index.html" in a Web Browser. The implementation should work without a web server, except for the predefined examples. To see the examples working, drop the source code in a Web server, for example [Python Simple HTTP Server](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html)
